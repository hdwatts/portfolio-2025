title: "How I Added Scalable Search to My Blog - Custom Astro & Pagefind Implementation"
description: "There's little documentation on building a custom Pagefind UI for an Astro site â€” so I figured I'd share my process. In this post, I'll walk you through setting it up, customizing the UI with React, and deploying it to Vercel - plus the challenges I ran into and how I solved them."

[Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) is a library that allows you to host a static search index for your users to query against. The key differentiating feature here is that it is a purely **static** implementation, so there is no extra infrastructure needed for my portfolio site. It is also packed with features, which I've only begun to scratch the service of...but the most important feature is it's speed and small bandwidth footprint.

Per the Pagefind maintainers:

> The goal of Pagefind is that websites with tens of thousands of pages should be searchable by someone in their browser, while consuming as little bandwidth as possible. [...] Pagefind can run a full-text search on a 10,000 page site with a total network payload under 300kB, including the Pagefind library itself. For most sites, this will be closer to 100kB.

Doing a quick test on my small blog, we can see their predictions are spot on.
