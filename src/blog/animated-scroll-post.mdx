In this post I'll walk through how I made the infinite scroll
tech stack showcase that is on the home page. It was accomplished
with Tailwind CSS and nearly entirely just using it's utility
classes.

> Note: I'm using the new 4.0 version of Tailwind CSS.

## Requirements Gathering

When I started rebuilding my portfolio at the start of 2025,
I had a vision for how I wanted to display the various libraries,
frameworks, and languages I've used throughout my career.

<div class="my-4 flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-2">
	<img
		class="outline-secondary rounded-2xl outline"
		src="/blog/animated-scroll-post/vision.png"
		width={400}
		alt="The vision I had for my infinite scrolling showcase."
	/>
	<div class="text-xs">The vision...simple right?</div>
</div>

Let's break down the requirements:

- We need a collection of tiles in a grid
- Each tile needs to have a logo corresponding to something I've worked with professionally
- The tiles need to be rotated to provide a nice 3D effect
- The tiles need to be clickable and direct the user to a URL
- Each row of tiles needs to be offset from eachother
- The tiles need to be animated to appear to scroll through a viewport
- The scrolling needs to appear to go on infinitely
- When the user hovers over the viewport, the scrolling needs to pause

Separately, for my own growth, I wanted to see if I could create this
entirely in Tailwind CSS.

...ok that's a serious list of requirements, let's get to work!

## The Tile

To start. We need to make ourselves a button. I really like Josh Comeau's
[Building a Magical 3D Button](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/3d-button/)
as a starting point. However, I had to adjust it to work with Tailwind.

```astro live
<div class="bg-primary h-full w-full p-12">
	{/* The container */}
	<div
		className={"group/button padding-0 relative cursor-pointer border-0" +
			" bg-transparent outline-offset-4 hover:brightness-110" +
			" focus:not-[:focus-visible]!outline-none" +
			" transition-[filter]"}
	>
		{/* The shadow */}
		<span
			className={"absolute top-0 left-0 translate-y-1 rounded-xl will-change-transform" +
				" h-full w-full bg-black opacity-25" +
				" transition-transform ease-in-out" +
				" group-hover/button:translate-y-2" +
				" group-active/button:translate-y-0.5"}></span>
		{/* The edge */}
		<span
			className="absolute top-0 left-0 h-full w-full rounded-xl bg-[#141f2e] brightness-50"
		></span>
		{/* The top of the button */}
		<a
			className={"relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-8 select-none" +
				" h-full w-full -translate-y-2 rounded-xl bg-[#141f2e] will-change-transform" +
				" transition-transform ease-in-out" +
				" group-hover/button:-translate-y-3" +
				" group-active/button:-translate-y-0.5 group-active/button:duration-75"}
		>
			<div className="flex grow justify-center">
				{/* Logo here */}
			</div>
			<span
				className="text-primary shrink text-3xl"
				style={{ color: "hsl(0 0% 98%)" }}
			>
				{/* Text here */}
				Button
			</span>
		</a>
	</div>
</div>
```
